This game is solved by entering the right commands into a wheeled
rover to accomplish missions for exploring virtual worlds. That's
right, the players learn to program while playing the game.

* General Thoughts

  Evaluating the code that is upload in a safe manner is critical for
  this project. Otherwise, each /mission/ would include a /wrapper/
  of functions and support, and would be evaluated on the user's
  computer.

  I like the idea of a contained execution of
  JavaScript/CoffeeScript, but I may want to write it in Python just
  to level up with it, and then convert it later.

* Function Commands

* Simple Rover

  The program that is uploaded needs to return an object that we can
  then call functions.
