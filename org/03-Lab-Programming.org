That was a lot of typing in that previous console.  This next console
shows you how to repeat actions, using a command called =for..in=. 

In this case, we will repeat moving =forward= and turning to the
=left=. You just need to replace the =_= with the number of times we
should repeat the loop... that is, =4=.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  rv.connect("1-875E-65297D640A2D")

  d = 7
  for c in [1 .. _]
      rv.forward(d)   # Anything indent like this
      rv.left(90)     # will be repeated

  rv.dock()     # Oh, anything after # is ignored
#+END_SRC

The two commands that are /indented/ will be done repeatedly, and the
=rv.dock= command, since it is not indented, is not part of the loop.

Good job! I think you are ready for some more interesting missions.
