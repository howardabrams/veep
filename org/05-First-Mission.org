Hi, I'm Eugene, and I have both a problem and a tool you might use to solve
it. We landed an RV on an exoplanet, and I think it landed in a well or some
other big hole. We need to see if that is true and if there is any way out.

This particular RV has a device I made to tell you how steep the land is
in front of the RV.[fn:1] You can call =grade= with the distance to check, and
it will return the average /grade/ of that spot based on the area around it. A
grade is measured by how much the RV would go up for each meter it travels.

If it goes up 1 meter while traveling 1 meter (an angle 45°), we say that is
/100%/. Why, because we always times that fraction by 100. Most of our RVs
could tip over if they drive on a slope close to 100%, so we don't recommend
doing that. Less than 80% is good.

By the way, if the RV goes down 1 meter while traveling 1 meter, we say the
grade is /-100%/. Walls are /500%/, and cliffs are /-500%/.

Our first mission showed a bunch of walls around the RV.
Your mission is to drive around and scan the area to see if there is a safe
opening in the walls that we can drive out and explore more of the area.
This RV[fn:2] has a lot of energy (about 1000 decabrams), so if you can get farther
away than 20 meters, you've found a gap in the wall.

I typed in the following code that scans a complete circle 3 meters around the
RV, and then look at the *Log*. Seems that the hole the RV is in, is at least 9
meters across, since the grade is always pretty small. Looking through the
*Log* is annoying, do you have any better ideas?[fn:3]

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  rv.connect("5-75A2-0BB14BD6BC58k")

  for dir in [0..360] by 10
      rv.left(dir)
      g = grade(3)
      console.log(dir, g)

  rv.dock()

* Footnotes

[fn:1] The /Slope Detector/ sensor works like this. It scans a meter wide area
for the /expected distance/ and the /actual difference/. 

Let's suppose we want to measure the ground 2 meters away. We scan it
twice. Once at 2 meters and the other at 3.

The sensor sits 2 meters above the ground, so if the ground in front at 2 meters
away is flat, we scan at 45° and make sure it is √8 or /2.8284271247461903/.
Why? Because that formula, /a² + b² = c²/ and /2² + 2² = 8/.

Scanning for 3 meters means we move the scanner to an angle of /56.31°/. Why? Because the opposite
side of our triangle is 3, and our adjacent side is 2, and the /arctangent/ of
3/2 (written as /atan(1.5)/ is /56.31°/. We expect the scanner to read a
distance of /3.6 meters/ if the ground is flat.

If the distance less than this, the ground slopes up, and if the distance is
more, the ground slopes down.

If the ground slopes down so much that we can't get a reading, the scanner
returns 0. This means it is unsafe to drive the RV there, as it is probably a
cliff or something.

[fn:2] The specs for the *75A2* are impressive. It has the slope scanner and
1000 decabrams of energy, but it also has a soil and atmosphere analysis
engines.

The only thing it doesn't have is a camera, which would have been really
helpful at this time.

[fn:3] You can have a loop within a loop, like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  for dist in [1..10]
    for dir in [0..360] by 10
      rv.left(10)  # Turn by 10 more degrees
      g = grade(dist)
      # ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can also, only return /interesting/ values using an =if= command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  if g > 300
    console.log "Wall at", dir, "is", dist
#+END_EXAMPLE
