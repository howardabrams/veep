Oh, so you decided to work on the extra credit assignment? Good for you. To do
this assignment, you need to know a bit about /trigonometry/. If you don't,
just skip ahead to your [[file:05-First-Mission.org][First Mission]].

In this console, we are working with an RV in a lab with a large grid drawn on
the floor. We put a flag at some spots on the floor, and your job is to
move the RV to pick up each flag.

Here is a view looking down at the RV in the lab.

The Base is at /(0, 0)/ and if you move the RV /forward/ 1 meter, it will go
"up" to /(0, 1)/. Turn to the right 90°, and then go forward 2 meters, and the
RV will be at /(2, 1)/. Get it?

-------------

If you start at the Base, how would you drive the RV /directly/ to get
a flag at /(3, 3)/?  Of course, looking at the diagram on the right,
the RV should turn =rv.right(45)= and then move =rv.forward(4.24264)=. 
Why? Because of that old formula, /a² + b² = c²/ [fn:3], and since
both /a/ and /b/ are /3/, we want to move forward /√18/... which is /4.24/.

If you start again at the Base, how would you drive the RV directly to get a flag
sitting at /(3, 4)/? 

Since /3² + 4² = 25/, and /√25 = 5/, we need to move =rv.forward(5)=, but what is the
angle? As you can see in the drawing on the right, we want to find the angle 
at the bottom. We can use the /arctangent/ of the length of the /opposite/ side divided by
the /adjacent/ side:[fn:1]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
right( atan(3/4) )  # Turns RV 36.87°
#+END_EXAMPLE

------------

Now, for a difficult problem. What if the RV is still at /(3, 4)/ and
still pointing at /36°/, and you need to tell the RV to go to /(-2,
5)/? [fn:2]

#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src="images/diagram-2-by-5.png"/>
#+END_HTML

Can you pick up the following flags?

  - /(4, 3)/
  - /(-2, 5)/
  - /(1, -3)/

I've got the first one done already:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  connect "3-875E-65297D640A2D"

  # First Flag
  left atan(3/4)
  forward square_root( square(3) + square(4) )
  grab flag

  # Second Flag

  # Third Flag

  dock()
#+END_SRC

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Why yes, we could use either the /arcsine/ or the /arc cosine/, since
all three of these calculations are the same:

  - =asin(3/5)= = 36.86989764584402
  - =acos(4/5)= = 36.86989764584401
  - =atan(3/4)= = 36.86989764584402

It just depends on which sides you use!

[fn:2] The triangle from /3/ to /-2/ is over /5/ and up 1 for a
/distance/ of /√26/. 

If your turn the RV =rv.left(36)=, it will face the RV
straight up, and we need to keep turning =rv.left= =atan(5/1)=
(about 78.70°), so our commands could be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
rv.left( atan(5/1) + atan(3/4) )
rv.forward( square_root(26) )
rv.grabFlag()
#+END_EXAMPLE

[fn:3] The formula, /a² + b² = c²/, only works for /right
triangles/ with one corner being /90°/. It says that if you square
both "legs" of the triangle and add them together, it will equal the
square of the long side (called the /hypotenuse/).

For example, if one side is /3/ and other the short side is /4/,
the formula shows that hypotenuse is /5/:
