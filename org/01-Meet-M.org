Hi, I'm M, and I'm glad to see I've got some help. I've been working
hard to make it easy to instruct the RVs. Each has a window into its
mind where you can tell it what to do. We call the window a /console/
and the commands we want it to do is /code/ and a mission to
accomplish is a /program/. Go it?

Good. I see this will be easy.

The first mission is pretty simple. We'll have the RV move out from
its base station 10 meters, and then drive backwards 10 meters
back. This is just to get your feet wet.

Here is a console, and I've already typed the code that makes up the
mission. Pretty simple since I have a commands called =forward= and
=backward=:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div style="clear:both"></div>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_SRC js  
  connect "0-875E-65297D640A2D"

  forward 4
  backward 4
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The first command, =connect= links your console with a particular
RV. Don't worry about the garbely-gook after the =connect= command,
that just identifies which RV to send these commands. That one is in a
particular lab with a nice, clear floor.

We move the RV forward 4 meters, and then backwards 4 meters. Once it
is done (if it is close enough), it attaches itself back to the base
station.   Always end at the base, so that it can re-charge.

In the lab, it isn't so much of a problem, since the technicians can
move and re-connect it. However, if your RV is roving around a
dustball around Alpha Centaurii, we have to send a new ship through
the right worm hole.
