Hi, I'm M, and I'm glad to see I've got some help. I've been working
hard to make it easy to instruct the RVs. Each has a window into its
mind where you can tell it what to do. We call the window a /console/
and the commands we want it to do is /code/ and a mission to
accomplish is a /program/. Go it?

Good. I see this will be easy.

The first mission is pretty simple. We'll have the RV move out from
its base station 10 meters, and then drive backwards 10 meters
back. This is just to get your feet wet.

Here is a console, and I've already typed the code that makes up the
mission. Pretty simple since I have a commands called =forward= and
=backward=:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div style="clear:both"></div>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_SRC js  
  rv.connect("0-875E-65297D640A2D")
  rv.forward(4)
  rv.backward(4)
  rv.dock()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

First, you'll notice that everything starts with =rv=. That shows you what I
made, and I'm pretty proud of it. The first command, =connect= links
your console with a particular RV. Don't worry about the garbely-gook
in the quotes, that is just the key to identify a particular RV. That
one is in a particular lab with a nice, clear floor.

We move the RV forward 4 meters, and then backwards 4 meters. Once it
is done, we have it attach itself back to the base station. If it
doesn't have that command, it can be communicated and becomes lost.

In the lab, it isn't so much of a problem, since the technicians
there, we just pick it up and re-connect it. However, if your RV is
roving around a dustball around Alpha Centaurii, we have to send a
new ship through the right worm hole... at least, until the
government agencies decide that worm hold travel is safe for humans.
