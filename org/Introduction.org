This is a game where you accomplish missions by controlling robots.

The twist is that instead of mindlessly moving your robots with a
joystick or keyboard, you control it with /your mind/. That's right,
you think about what the robot should do, and give it a bunch of
commands. You then look at what happened after... as if the robot was
on another plant and could only communicate with you every now and
then.

Why yes, this is my sinister attempt at teaching programming by
playing a game.
