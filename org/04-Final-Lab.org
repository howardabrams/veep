Here is a console to another RV, but the lab where it lives isn't
all nice, smooth cement. This one is partly covered in loose marbles!
Don't laugh, we have sent our RVs to some pretty odd planets.

The RV will slip on marbles, so sending it forward 1 meter,
may mean it doesn't really travel for a full meter.

This is important when trying to make sure you have enough energy to
get back to the base station. Let's start by moving in a square 7
meters on a side.  How far do you think we will have traveled?

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  rv.connect("2-875E-65297D640A2D");

  for x in [1 .. 4]
      rv.forward(_);
      rv.left(90);

  rv.dock();
#+END_SRC

Normally, if an RV traveled in a square with 7 meters on a side, it
should travel 49 meters, right? But the **Distance Traveled** on this
RV shows it didn't travel quite that far.

Can you figure out where the marbles begin?
