So you're the new engineer? Welcome aboard. This project will soon
have visibility all the way up, and it is important that we don't mess
up and loose any RVs.

What? You don't know what is an RV? Didn't the kids down at
headquarters brief you on your mission and duties? Don't worry, I'll
do their job, but I'm not doing yours, okay?

We have spent millions creating and launching robotic probes through
every known worm hole in the solar system. The probes gave us a list
of exoplants to explore, and now we've spent billions creating and
launching robotic vehicles to do the work of investigating and
exploring these planets. We call them RVs for short.

Each RV has a base station with an energy generator, so it is very
important that they return back to their base before they run out of
energy. This is also the only place where they can communicate.

Each day, we send it their daily mission. We wait until it returns and
sends us the results. And this is where your mission comes into
play. We give you a mission, and you translate that to the RV. Got it?

If I told you to scratch your head, you could probably do it without
any more information, but RVs aren't that sophisticated... at least,
not now. You will need to be more precise. But I understand you
engineers think that is fun.

Since you are just starting, I'm going to give you an RV that is
actually sitting in a warehouse in downtown New Houston. That way, if
you mess up, we can carry the RV over to its base station.

Base Station? Lots of power is required to communicate through worm
holes so only the /base station/ sends signals. The RVs can only talk
to us if they are connected to the base station. So when you send an
RV on a mission, /make sure it comes back/. Otherwise, it is lost.

I'll check in with you from time to time, but you'll be working with
M. She's the best engineering trainer, and has personally been
developing the RV's brain, so you should be up to speed in no time.
